# Plotly-Belly-Button-Diversity

Built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, that catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

# Final Results

For the process we built functions and pulled Data from the json file, then the principal object of this project it was to created a dashboard using HTML and its tags in which weÂ´ll display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
With this we built a Graph and a Bubble Chart which displays data linked to the demographic table, the plus of this dashboard is that is an interactive dashboard, this means that when a new data was selected from the dropdown, the charts display the change.
